        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated cheese (cheddar, Gruyère, or your favorite)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh herbs (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate the egg yolks and whites into two bowls.</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg yolks with the milk until well combined, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the yolk mixture, being careful not to deflate the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat until melted and slightly bubbling.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan, spreading it out evenly. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the bottom is set and lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the grated cheese over one half of the omelette, then carefully fold the other half over the cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a lid and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the omelette is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate, garnish with chopped fresh herbs if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
